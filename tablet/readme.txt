This is the revamped tablet-laptop hybrid for cyclica, bringing a cleaner design, 
fluid animations, and simple navigation to the Client.

For all intents and purposes, other than a collection of libraries, functions, and refrences, 
this iteration of Cyclica Desktop will replace the previous ReactionDE in both externally
and internally. A whole new engine has been made to set up windowing, one that may take some getting used to.
The design is based off i3 window manager, and gnome's Material shell, but set up using web technology.

Enjoy!!
