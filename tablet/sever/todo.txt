now that we have a decent windowing system, it's time to focus on the main event: tunneling a framebuffer to the div's with novnc.
TODO 1: add noVNC frames into Cyclica UI
2: establish a port forwarded connection to the server (ie. fuck localhost)
3: speed up graphics by building virtualgl for chroot (chrooted environment not necessary, just how i set up my distro)\
4: create new chroot with modded xfce and dependencies, build rom
5: polish serverside UI in Xfce
6: Polish Clientside UI (gestures, window resizing)
7: publish and release
8: kickstarter funded cyclica books?
9: (in thanos voice)
